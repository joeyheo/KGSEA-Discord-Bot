 Korean Gifted Students Evaluation Association (K.G.S.E.A.) is a non-profit organization officially registered in Korea and it was established in 2009. K.G.S.E.A. have been opened a new door to pass on proper educational information and to discover gifted students, and we have been provided more opportunities for Korean students to participate in a diverse range of international competitions.

  Our organization consists of approximately 8,000 members including individuals, schools and private institutions. Many Korean schools and Korean parents rely on us so that their students and children can have opportunities to take specialized international tests such as AMC (American Mathematics Competitions) and HMMT (Harvard MIT Mathe Tournament) and ARML (American Regions Mathematics League) and WMTC (World Mathematics Championship) Each year, 2,000-2,500 students register to those of competitions through us in Korea.

  Most of all, we are proud to say that we are running international competitions fairly in Korea and the biggest number of students have been registered through us. We want to open a new chapter for the fair assessment for the best and we will actively promote it and find ways for students to participate in it in Korea.

Korean Gifted Students Evaluation Association (K.G.S.E.A.) hopes that our small dreams will bear good fruits.

As a member of a KGSEA member with slight coding knowledge ðŸ˜‰, I decided to make a discord bot to help management of our discord server. 
I've decided to open source this, because why not?
